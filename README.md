for me to put practice projects revolving around web3 and blockchain

token design -- Stone Token, STN

1) initial supply is sent to owner --> 50% of max supply [done]
2) capped supply --> 100 m? [done]
3) remaining supply is used for minting system (mining reward?)[done]
4) create block reward
    _beforeTokenTransfer --> control what happens right before transfer complete
    _mintMinerReward --> control what the mint reward is for each block mined
